===========

This repository contains scripts.js and other items used on the Game Corner Pokemon Online server.

*** Guidelines for contributors ***

DON'T USE THE TAB CHARACTER. The scripts use 4 spaces and the mix of tab and spaces is what
causes the formatting issues at times.
You can set Notepad++ to use 4 spaces when the tab key is hit though if you use that to edit.
Settings->Preferences->Language Menu/Tab Settings
Set it to "Tab Size 4" and tick the replace with space box

Using jshint for checking some coding style is recommended.
In particular, following practices are frowned upon:
- tab character when indenting (see above)
- trailing whitespace
- undefined variables (always use var in the outermost scope for that variable)
